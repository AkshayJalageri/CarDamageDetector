🚗 Car Damage Detection Using YOLOv8, OpenCV & Flask

An AI-powered system for detecting and marking car dents or damages from both images and live video feeds. This solution can serve as a game-changer for the **automotive** and **insurance** industries by enabling automated damage inspection using deep learning.

✨ Features

* Detects multiple types of car damages and dents using a YOLOv8 model
* Works on both **images** and **live video feeds**
* Uses **OpenCV** for image/video processing
* Flask-based **web interface** for uploading images and viewing results
* Outputs labeled and marked damaged areas with confidence scores

🧪 Training the YOLOv8 Model

1. Download the **custom dataset** (car dents and damage) from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
2. Use **Google Colab** for training with GPU acceleration.
3. Upload dataset to `My Drive/Datasets/CarDent`.
4. Modify `data.yaml` path:

   ```yaml
   path: ../drive/MyDrive/Datasets/CarDent
   ```
5. Run the following in Colab:

   ```python
   !pip install ultralytics
   !yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8l.pt data=../content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/CarDent/data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
   ```
6. Download `best.pt` from the `runs/detect/train/weights/` folder and place it in the `Weights/` directory.

🖼️ Detect Car Damage in an Image

Run the standalone image detection script:

```bash
python CarDentDetector.py
```

It will load `dent_1.jpg` from the `Media/` folder, detect damages, and display bounding boxes and labels.

---

🌐 Web Interface Using Flask

Step 1: Start Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

Step 2: Access Web App

Open browser and visit: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) (may differ in your system)

Step 3: Upload Image

Upload a car image via the UI. The app will process and display bounding boxes for detected damages. Click the **Download** button to save the processed image.

---

📽️ Live Video Detection (Optional)

To detect damages from a video feed (e.g., webcam or video file):

```bash
python CarDentDetectorLive.py
```
